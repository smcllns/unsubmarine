## Dev setup

Note: The built chrome extension is in `/extension` and some static assets are already there. The `/content` folder is generated by building `/src` (see below).

1. Install dependencies: `npm i`
2. Compile the svelte app: `npm run build`
3. Load unpacked extension into Chrome: [https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#manifest](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#manifest)
4. Visit gmail which is the only URL this extension targets: [mail.google.com](mail.google.com)
5. Dev: `npm run dev`
